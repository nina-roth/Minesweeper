# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game in QT/QML -- minimum version Qt 5.5

The master branch uses Menus for navigation (selecting difficulty etc), which have been tested on Mac/Windows/Ubuntu. If they don't show up, the "Qt_Version_5p5" branch has buttons!

To compile:

1) Download or clone the repository
2) In the repository type "qmake" -> this should create a Makefile
3) Type "make" to create the application
4) Run application (and avoid the mines!)
