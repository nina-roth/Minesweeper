# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game in QT/QML

The master branch requires Qt 5.8! If you have Qt 5.5 the "Qt_Version_5p5" branch should work!

To compile:

1) Download or clone the repository
2) In the repository type "qmake" -> this should create a Makefile
3) Type "make" to create the application
4) Run application (and avoid the mines!)
